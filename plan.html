<p> Goals
  
  </p>
<p>Goal of this website is to produce an increase of 50% more  customers to join the club (mostly younger audience), increase revenues and  maximize profitability. Website gives customer a clear understanding what they  look for and how to join. Call for action is provided in Home Page. Our mission  is to give quality and affordable training to our students in a friendly environment.  </p>
<p> Success Evaluation
  
  </p>
<p>Comparing the number of members before and after (website is  published) at the club. If we can see more member at the location we can see  website has achieved its goal. Site&rsquo;s success can be evaluated using this  process. </p>
<p>Target Audience
  
  </p>
<ol>
  <li>Volleyball is a great family sport so we get  players of all ages but mostly 35-50. But goal of this website is to attract  younger audience and kids to join the club while they&rsquo;re in high school, so age  15 to 30. </li>
  <li>We can gather younger audience by having more  competitive games rather non-competitive. Also we can add bars and events to  get customers socialize. Having competitive photo galleries to motivate the  viewers and a colourful layout with clear texts to grab their attention.   </li>
</ol>
